# Physics Matter

This is one of the most fleshed out games I ever made in Clickteam when I was 12 years old.

This was extracted with Anaconda because I do not have the original MFA as of now (currently stuck on a corrupted hard drive).

Perspective.mfx is a needed extension to use the MFA.

Platformer.mfx is a needed extension to use the MFA.

Even if this game is quite simple, I think it had potential to be fun. Looking back I really liked the mechanics it introduced. One issue is the difficulty of each level varying wildly. Level 2 abuses a mechanic from the game itself, but I feel like most wouldn't even notice it. I'm not sure why I had a time limit of 30 seconds either, or at least I don't know why I made it so it doesn't reset if you die.

I made one change to the MFA because it included some music from other games, which I don't really want included even if it wasn't accessible in the actual game.
